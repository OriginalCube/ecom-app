# Journey

A brief reflection on my journey in creating this project.

## Day 1 - Setup

I kicked off the project by initializing a new Nuxt 3 and Vue 3 setup, using the default templates. Since this was after work, time was limited. I managed to create a basic outline of tasks I’d need to tackle moving forward.

## Day 2 - Planning

With the project initiated, I shifted focus to planning. I compiled a list of features I wanted to implement, envisioned the structure of each page, and sketched out the components. Additionally, I finalized the tools and libraries I’d use throughout the development process.

## Day 3 - Initial Scramble

Development officially began, and I focused on setting up the foundational elements—file structure, components, and pages. However, progress was slow. A lack of a clear structure made it difficult to organize the project effectively, and I also spent time deliberating which API would be best suited for my needs.

## Day 4 - Smooth Sailing

After the challenges of Day 3, Day 4 felt like a breeze. With a solid foundation in place, I was able to implement multiple features and saw significant progress. This was also the day I truly appreciated how far I’ve come, not just in this project, but as a developer.

## Reflections

This project was both fun and insightful. I learned a lot along the way and gained a deeper understanding of my progress over the years. While I had to omit some features due to time constraints, I’m proud of the end result, and the experience was incredibly rewarding.
